# Numerical Methods - Projects | Gdańsk University of Technology 2024

This repository contains projects completed during the "Numerical Methods" course in the fourth semester. The projects cover various numerical techniques, including interpolation, solving linear systems, and financial analysis, using Python, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

## Project 1: MACD Indicator

This project involved implementing the MACD indicator using Python. The `pandas` library was used for data processing. MACD and SIGNAL lines were calculated to identify buy/sell signals based on crossovers. The results were visualized using `matplotlib`. A trading simulation was implemented to evaluate the indicator’s performance.

## Project 2: Solving Linear Systems

This project focused on implementing and analyzing two iterative methods (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) and one direct method (LU Decomposition) for solving linear systems. The `matplotlib` library was used for visualizing the results, including plotting the convergence of residual norms for the iterative methods and comparing the execution times for different methods. The performance of each method was analyzed in terms of iterations, execution time, and accuracy.

## Project 3: Height Profile Approximation

This project focused on implementing and analyzing two interpolation methods: Lagrange interpolation and cubic spline interpolation. The `pandas` library was used to handle the height data, while `matplotlib` was used for visualizing the interpolation results. The goal was to approximate height profiles using both methods and evaluate their accuracy. The analysis included the effects of node distribution (linear vs. Chebyshev nodes) and the number of interpolation nodes on the quality of the approximation.
